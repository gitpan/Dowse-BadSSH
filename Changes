Version 0.08:
   - Use File::Find for good interactive performance
   - Also display 'unknown' keys
   - Add 1024- and 4096-bit RSA key blacklists
   - Add a simple test script to shut up CPAN::Reporters

Version 0.07:
   - the script wasn't warning about the wrong two combinations of
     1024-bit, 2048-bit, rsa and dsa.  Warn for all of them.  This
     is really a FIXME: add a blacklist for these combinations.

Version 0.06:
   - Fix statistics display - was always showing 0 weak keys found

Version 0.05:
   - Protect from a usage error
   - check for the proper ssh host filename
   - go back to perl 5.10.0 versions of File::Temp etc

Version 0.04:
   - REALLY fix the -r bug.  Ho hum.

Version 0.03:
   - the '-r' option was removing the whole line, rather than
     commenting it out.  whoops.
   - bundle File/Spec.pm etc from perl 5.8.4
