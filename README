run from here as:

  dowkd=`pwd`

  perl $dowkd/bin/dowkd.pl

To clean your system:

  perl $dowkd/bin/dowkd.pl all-ssh -R -f

You can re-use the above command as you cd around the target system.

If you checked this out of git, you won't have anything under inc/
First, get a recent Module::Install and then:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make manifest
  make dist

You might need to do this to make it bundle a File::Spec which will
work with the target version of Perl.

Note: git is at git://git.catalyst.net.nz/Dowse-BadSSH.git
